# About Azure

## The Basics of Azure

Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft that offers a wide range of cloud services, including compute, storage, networking, databases, and more. It allows you to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through a global network of data centers.

## Azure Regions and Availability Zones

An `Azure region` is a geographical area with one or more data centers. `Availability zones` are distinct locations within a region that have independent power, cooling, and networking. By using multiple availability zones, you can improve the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.

## Azure Structure and Organisation

Azure is organized into a hierarchical structure, with subscriptions at the top level. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- Subscription

  - A logical container for all your Azure resources.
  - You can have multiple subscriptions to manage different workloads or budgets.
  - Each subscription has its own billing and quota settings.

- Resource Group

  - A container for related Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.
  - Resource groups help you organize your resources and manage them as a group.
  - You can deploy, manage, and delete resources within a resource group.

- Resource

  - The individual services and components within Azure.
  - Examples of resources include virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, and virtual networks.
  - Resources are deployed within resource groups.
