# Two=tier App Deployment

## Link the app and mongodb

- SSH into the App and MongoDB virtual machines
- Make sure your app is not running. So, don't run `npm start`
- Make sure the database is running: ` sudo systemctl status mongod`
- Make sure you cd into the app folder: `cd app/`
- In the app vm, create environment variables for database connection string
- The IP is the Private IP address of the database
- `export DB_HOST=mongodb://10.0.3.4:27017/posts`
- `printenv DB_HOST` # checks that the variable is created
- `npm install` # This will populate your database with dummy data
- `npm start`
- `http://51.142.8.97:3000/posts`
- `node seeds/seed.js` # this manually populate everything in the database.
